                                members were people who had migrated to Bangalore from Mumbai,
                                Karnataka, Hyderabad-Karnataka region during the reorganisation
                                of states. The sangha which started a primary school in 1959-60 now
                                runs 17 educational institutions from kindergarten to graduate college
                                with the noble motive of educating and empowering children mainly from
                                economically underprivileged background.<br>
